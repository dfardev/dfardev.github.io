title: SimFit Startup
description: Led cross-functional SimFit design and research team to create a user-centered app to gamify workouts utilizing agile sprint methodologies. Deployed extensive, multi-staged user studies to gauge user base and identify best-fit applications for the product, resulting in utilization of Figma, Unity, VR + AR toolkits and Meta Quest II to create requested user-facing features in a functional pipeline working from product to design. I was responsible for the deployment of low-fidelity prototypes focusing on AR & VR capabilities to increase product gamification based on iterative user feedback. I can't share the Unity prototype that was created, but I also worked on low fidelity prototypes for gamification (one linked below).
skills: 
  - Unity
  - UX Research
  - Qualitative Analysis
  - Quantitative Analysis
  - 3D game scripting
  - C#
