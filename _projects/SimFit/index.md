title: SimFit Startup
description: Led the cross-functional SimFit design and research team in developing a user-centered fitness application that gamifies workouts through immersive technologies. Utilized agile sprint methodologies to guide development and coordinated multi-phase user studies to define target audiences and align features with user needs. The project integrated tools such as Figma, Unity, AR/VR toolkits, and Meta Quest 2 to prototype and deliver key user-facing features. My primary contributions focused on designing and deploying low-fidelity AR and VR prototypes to enhance engagement and gamification, as well as iterating based on continuous user feedback gained from user surveys and post-demo surveys. While the Unity prototype cannot be publicly shared, the low-fidelity gamification prototype linked below demonstrates core interaction concepts.
