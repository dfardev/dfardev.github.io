title: UX VR Research Study
description: Using HMDs of Various Complexity to Compare Gaze-Based and Button-Based Selection Methods Led a student research team to study different VR selection methods (both industry standard and research-based methods) in order to quantitatively and qualitatively determine what selection methods were best suited to virtual environments of varying complexity. Deployed extensive, multi-staged iterative user studies to gauge user base and identify best-fit selection methods, resulting in utilization of Unity, VR + AR toolkits and Meta Quest II.
