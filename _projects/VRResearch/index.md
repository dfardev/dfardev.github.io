title: UX VR Comparative Study of Gaze-Based vs. Button-Based Selection Methods Using HMDs of Varying Complexity
description: Led a student research team in a comprehensive study evaluating VR selection techniques (both industry-standard and experimental) in immersive environments of differing complexity. Designed and executed multi-phase, iterative user studies to collect quantitative and qualitative data on user interaction patterns and preferences. Utilized Unity, AR/VR toolkits, and the Meta Quest II to prototype, deploy, and test interaction models. This ultimately identified optimal selection methods when presented with diverse virtual scenarios.
