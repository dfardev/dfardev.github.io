name: Donovan Farar
headline: Software engineer specializing in gameplay programming, technical design and game design
description: >- # dont remove this line. this will ignore all new lines until the next section
  I’m Donovan Farar, a software engineer with a passion for game and technical design. 
  For the past 6 years, I’ve been working with Unity and Unreal, 
  building small-scale projects as part of academic projects as well as VR research studies.
  I've participated in game jams and earned a certificate in game design, which pushed my creativity and problem-solving skills. 
  These experiences have shaped my approach to development—fast, flexible, and focused on delivering engaging player experiences.
  Now I’m creating my first full-length game, which I’m currently developing alongside a talented team. 
  From systems programming to gameplay mechanics, I thrive at the intersection of design and technology.
  Games may be my passion, but I also excel in UX research studies and methodologies, as well as 
  database programming and management. I professionally come from a aoftware engineer in healthcare background
  with nearly 3 years of experience in SQL, Azure, and database mangagment tools.
